# Test Utils

This was almost entirely copied over from core/backend/src/test/index.ts in [iTwin.js](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core)
from before the package was moved here, when we could rely on importing `@itwin/core-backend/lib/cjs/test` which was linked within
that monorepo, but not published.
